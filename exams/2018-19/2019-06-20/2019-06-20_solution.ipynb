    "### General Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Python Programming (for Data Science)** exam session! Please, read **carefully** the instructions below before start writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This session will last **75 minutes** and is divided into **two parts**: one about \"general\" Python programming and the other about Python programming for Data Science. Each part is made of a set of exercises, which globally accounts for **16** + **16** = **32 points**.\n",
    "You will earn all of the points associated to an exercise **if and only if** the answer you provide passes successfully **all** the tests (both those that are visible and those that are hidden to you).<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually write down your implementation, make sure to fill in any place that says <code style=\"color:green\">**_# YOUR CODE HERE_**</code>. Note also that you should **either comment or delete** any <code style=\"color:green\">**raise NotImplementedError()**</code> exception.<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exam session **you will not be allowed** to use any lecture material yet you will be able to access the following APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html)\n",
    "-  [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/)\n",
    "-  [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.0.0/reference/)\n",
    "-  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/api.html)\n",
    "-  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.1/api/index.html)\n",
    "-  [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done, save this notebook and rename it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>**YOURUSERNAME_2019-06-20.ipynb**</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "where <code>**YOURUSERNAME**</code> is your actual username. To be consistent, we are expecting your username to be composed by your first name's initial, followed by your full lastname. As an example, in my case this notebook must be saved as <code>**gtolomei_2019-06-20.ipynb**</code> (Remember to insert an underscore <code>**'_'**</code> between your username and the date).<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, go back to the [Moodle](https://elearning.studenti.math.unipd.it/esami/mod/assign/view.php?id=528) web page of the \"**2019-06-20 Python Programming Exam**\"; there, you will be able to upload your notebook file for grading.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that there is no limit on the number of submissions; however, be careful when you upload a new version of this notebook because each submission overwrites the previous one. \n",
    "The due date indicated above is **strict**; after that, the system will not accept any more submissions and the latest uploaded notebook will be the one considered for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archive you have downloaded (<code style=\"color:magenta\">**2019-06-20-exam.tar**</code>) is orgaized as follows:\n",

    "In this exercise, you will train a simplified *unigram language model* **for each** document contained in the <code><b>corpus</b></code> collection. Having one model for each document, we will in turn use it to compute a ranked list of the documents which are most likely \"similar\" to a given input query (i.e., a string).<br />\n",
    "In a nutshell, the *unigram language model* needs you to compute the probabilty associated with each word in the document, **disregarding any other surrounding words** (i.e., no contextual information is used to estimate such a probability). More specifically, assuming $V = \\{w_1, \\ldots, w_{N_d}\\}$ is the vocabulary of $N_d$ words extracted from the document $d$, then its associated model $M_d$ will be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "P(w_i) = \\frac{\\text{count}(w_i, d)}{\\sum_{w_j\\in d}\\text{count}(w_j, d)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we can train several models $M_1, \\ldots, M_N$, i.e., one for each document in our corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all those models are in place, you will be able to implement the function <code><b>get_most_similar_docs</b></code>, which takes as input a string <code><b>query</b></code> and an integer <code><b>k</b></code>, and returns an **ordered list of** <code><b>k</b></code> **pairs**. Each element of such a list is a tuple made of $(doc_d, prob)$, where $prob$ is the probability of the query $q = t_1\\ldots t_m$ given the trained unigram language model associated with document $d$, i.e., $P(q = t_1\\ldots t_m~|~M_d)$, which can be computed as follows:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "prob(q~|~M_d) = \\prod_{i=1}^k P(t_i~|~M_d)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "To ease this step, you are already given with the function <code><b>compute_probability</b></code>, which takes as input a query $q$ (i.e., a list of words) and a document model $M_d$, and returns the probability $P(q~|~M_d)$ as described above.\n",
